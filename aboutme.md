In 2019 I earned a B.S. in Quantitative Economics and Mathematics from Tufts University in Sommerville, MA, where I discovered my affinity for economic theory, econometrics, and probability. 
In the same year I began my PhD in Economics at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR, where I currently live and work. 
Originally I'm from Tbilisi, Georgia, but before moving to the United States I spent my teenage years in Kyiv, Ukraine, where I graduated from Kyiv International School in 2015.
My experiences across all of these places -- witnessing regional instability, volatility, and war, but also growth and innovation -- have inspired my fascination with complex dynamic systems, and naturally shaped me into a macroeconomist.
My goal is to build on the progress of my brilliant colleagues in the field to ultimately put at least an additional dent in our understanding of how macroeconomic policy can be used to improve the robustness of the global economy.

Outside of research and teaching, most of my hobbies revolve around learning and creating -- I enjoy playing jazz and blues guitar, making art by either sculpting or woodworking, being a mediocre chess player (you can sometimes find me messing around on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/gionikola)), lifting weights or doing calisthenics at the UO Rec Center, practicing mixed martial arts, growing a vegetable garden, learning about software and computers, exploring topics in mathematics that I had neglected as an undergraduate student, learning new languages, and more. 

I am always happy to speak to people with similar interests, whether it be economics or something unrelated, so please feel welcome to reach out!
