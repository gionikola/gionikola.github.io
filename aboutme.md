In 2019, I earned a B.S. in Quantitative Economics and Mathematics from Tufts University in Massachusetts, where I discovered my affinity for economic theory, econometrics, and probability. 
In the same year, I began my PhD in Economics at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR, where I currently reside.
Originally, I'm from Georgia, but before moving to the United States I spent my teenage years in Ukraine, where I graduated from Kyiv International School in 2015.
My experiences across these places -- witnessing regional instability, volatility, and war, but also growth and innovation -- have inspired my fascination with complex dynamical systems from a young age, and naturally shaped me into a macroeconomist.
My goal is to put an additional dent in our understanding of how macroeconomic policy can be used to sustain growth and stability, and steer us away from crises.

Outside of my work as a researcher, my hobbies revolve around learning and creating.
Among other things, I enjoy playing jazz/blues guitar, sculpting, woodworking, playing chess, practicing mixed martial arts, vegetable gardening, and learning new languages.

I am always happy to speak to people with similar interests, whether it be economics or something unrelated, so please feel welcome to reach out!
