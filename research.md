["The Evolution of Community Bank Interconnectedness"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v5cE693qDAx3z3vlZ_voRbUePFVwBMWx/view?usp=sharing).

<b>Abstract:</b>
I estimate national and regional latent drivers of quarterly fluctuations of state-average community bank return-on-equity (ROE) for all 50 US states. 
I do so by modeling a dataset of state-average community bank ROE series as a multi-level / hierarchical dynamic factor model (HDFM), which I then estimate using Bayesian methods to extract posterior distributions of country- and region-level dynamic factors. 
I find a decrease in the intensity of idiosyncratic dynamics of state-level community bank profitability since the global financial crisis, along with an increase in national comovement across most states. 
I conclude that the US community banking sector has become more interconnected since the crisis, which implies greater exposure to systemic risk and increased vulnerability during future financial crises.

["Measuring Economic Activity in the Presence of Superstar MNEs"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357001079_Measuring_Economic_Activity_in_the_Presence_of_Superstar_MNEs) with Philip Economides.

<b>Abstract:</b> 
In 2015, changes to Irish tax legislation, known as the "2015 Finance Act", coincided with a 25 percent annual increase in real gross domestic product. 
We provide evidence confirming the convictions of existing literature that the presence of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) is likely to have "distorted" Irish GDP, a measure previously considered to be a reliable proxy of domestic economic activity. 
Furthermore, we provide an alternative method of statistically isolating the variation in GDP growth attributable solely to domestic activity growth to infer the prevailing state of the Irish economy.
Our findings imply a 21% lower level of GDP relative to the official measure recorded for 2020. 
We suggest that our methodology may be applied by policymakers in small open economies to improve the accuracy of growth and business cycle monitoring.

# <b>Software</b>

### <b>DynamicFactorModeling.jl</b>

[DynamicFactorModeling.jl](https://github.com/gionikola/DynamicFactorModeling.jl) is a Julia package I'm currently creating that allows users to simulate, estimate, and forecast using multi-level dynamic factor models.
My focus at the moment is on Bayesian estimators, as they allow for inference on the latent factors, although I plan on including classical estimators in the future.

### <b>Library of Statistical Techniques (LOST)</b>

[LOST](https://lost-stats.github.io/) is an open source website with the goal of making it easy to execute statistical techniques in statistical software.
I am an author of multiple pages, and have written the Julia sections of others across time series methods.
