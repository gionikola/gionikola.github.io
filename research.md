# Working Papers 

"Measuring Economic Activity in the Presence of Superstar MNEs" with Philip Economides.

<b>Abstract:</b> 
In 2015, changes to Irish tax legislation, known as the "2015 Finance Act", coincided with a 25 percent annual increase in real gross domestic product. 
We provide evidence confirming the convictions of existing literature that the presence of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) is likely to have ``distorted" Irish GDP, a measure previously considered to be a reliable proxy of domestic economic activity. 
Furthermore, we provide an alternative method of statistically isolating the variation in GDP growth attributable solely to domestic activity growth to infer the prevailing state of the Irish economy.
Our findings imply a 21% lower level of GDP relative to the official measure recorded for 2020. 
We suggest that our methodology may be applied by policymakers in small open economies to improve the accuracy of growth and business cycle monitoring.

# Open Source Contributions

### DynamicFactorModeling.jl

DynamicFactorModeling.jl is a Julia package I'm currently creating that allows users to simulate, estimate, and forecast using multi-level dynamic factor models.
My focus at the moment is on Bayesian estimators, as they allow for inference on the latent factors, although I plan on including classical estimators in the future.

### Library of Statistical Techniques (LOST)

LOST is a publicly-editable website with the goal of making it easy to execute statistical techniques in statistical software.
My contributions target the execution of time series methods across Julia and R.
