My current research agenda focuses on the identification of hidden drivers behind macreconomic phenomena and measuring their dynamic effects. 
In my work I use a variety of statistical and time series econometric tools -- presently my focus is on dimension reduction in dynamic settings, specifically multi-level (hierarchical) dynamic factor modeling.
For these purposes I develop my own computational tools written using the Julia language that I make available on GitHub (check out <a href="https://github.com/gionikola/DynamicFactorModeling.jl">DynamicFactorModeling.jl</a>.
