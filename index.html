I am a macroeconomist studying monetary policy, financial stability, and the banking sector. 
I am mainly interested in identifying common and idiosyncratic factors that drive micro-level (e.g. bank-level) behavior, and then analyzing said factors to understand the distributional effects of various macroeconomic policies. 
Most of my current work is empirical in nature, but I also spend a lot of time developing econometric methods and exploring macroeconomic theory.

I develop my own computational tools using R and Julia, which I make available on <a href="https://github.com/gionikola">GitHub</a>, (for example, check out <a href="https://github.com/gionikola/DynamicFactorModeling.jl">DynamicFactorModeling.jl</a>)

Monitor current economic trends using my real-time <a href="https://giorginikolaishvili.com/data-reports">economic data report/dashboard</a> (updated daily).
At the moment this is a work in progress and mainly for personal use, but when completed I hope it provides value to those who also find themselves overwhelmed by the amount of information contained in daily economic and financial news.
