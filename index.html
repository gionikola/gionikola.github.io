I am a macroeconomist studying monetary policy, financial stability, and the banking sector. 
My interest is in identifying common and idiosyncratic factors that drive micro-level (e.g. bank-level) behavior, and then analyzing said factors to understand the distributional effects of various macroeconomic policies. 
Most of my current work is empirical in nature, but I also spend a lot of time developing econometric methods and exploring macroeconomic theory.

I develop my own computational tools in `R` and `Julia`, which I make available on GitHub (for example, check out <a href="https://github.com/gionikola/DynamicFactorModeling.jl">DynamicFactorModeling.jl</a>)
