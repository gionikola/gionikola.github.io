  I am a macroeconomist studying monetary policy, financial stability, and the banking sector. 
  My interest is in identifying common and idiosyncratic factors that drive micro-level (e.g. bank-level) behavior, and then analyzing said factors to understand the distributional effects of various macroeconomic policies. 
  Most of my current work is empirical in nature, but I also spend a lot of time developing new econometric methods, as well as exploring and attempting to refine existing ones.
