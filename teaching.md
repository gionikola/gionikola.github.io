# Independent Courses

### Money and Banking (EC370)

Fall 2021.

<b>Description:</b> 
In this course I teach students how the monetary and banking systems function, interact, and ultimately cause fluctuations in the macroeconomy.
I tend to put more emphasis on an intuitive understanding of how the incentives of key players and institutions across both systems drive their decision-making, which I then leverage to construct simplified yet informative models of the aggregate economy.
I then try to apply the models to as many historical episodes and realistic hypothetical scenarios as I possibly can, given the time constraint. 
The usual required textbook for this course at UO is Frederic Mishkin's <i>Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i>, but I use Laurence Ball's <i>Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i> while also drawing upon Mishkin's materials and <i>Foundations of Financial Markets and Institutions</i> (Fabozzi et al.).

### Monetary Policy (EC470)
