# <b>Independent Courses</b>

The following is a list of courses that I have independently prepared and taught as the instructor of record.

### <b>Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory (EC313)</b>

Asynchronous. Spring 2023. Class size: 120.

<b>Description:</b> 
This class is designed to provide economics majors and minors, as well as interested non-majors, the theoretical foundations necessary to understand the macroeconomic problems commonly confronted in developed market economies, and to evaluate solutions to those problems. 
I teach students how to build models that help explain fluctuations in output, employment, the price level, inflation, interest rates, and other key macroeconomic variables. 
Students also learn how to use models to understand how policy changes (for example, monetary policy, tax reductions, and deficit spending) may affect macroeconomic variables, with primary applications to the U.S. and other developed economies.
I build my course content around Olivier Blanchard's 8th edition of <i>Macroeconomics</i> using recent data, and provide more detailed coverage of certain topics.

### <b>Money and Banking (EC370)</b>

Fall 2021. Winter 2023. Class size: 60.

<b>Description:</b> 
In this course I teach students how the monetary and banking systems function, interact, and ultimately cause fluctuations in the macroeconomy.
I tend to put more emphasis on an intuitive understanding of how the incentives of key players and institutions across both systems drive their decision-making, which I leverage to construct simplified yet informative models of the aggregate economy.
I then try to apply the models to as many historical episodes and realistic hypothetical scenarios as I possibly can, given the time constraint. 
The usual required textbook for this course at University of Oregon is Frederic Mishkin's <i>Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i>, but I prefer to use Laurence Ball's <i>Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i> while also drawing upon Mishkin's materials and <i>Foundations of Financial Markets and Institutions</i> (Fabozzi et al.).

### <b>Monetary Policy (EC470)</b>

Summer 2021. Class size: 30.

<b>Description:</b>
In this course I teach students how the monetary system functions, and how central banks may use monetary policy to manipulate its trajectory.
I put less emphasis on quantitative modeling skills (for which the UO Econ. Department offers other advanced macroeconomics courses), and more on economic intuition, historical awareness, and institutional knowledge.
Similar to EC370, the required textbook for this course at University of Oregon is Frederic Mishkin's <i>Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i>, but I prefer to use Laurence Ball's <i>Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i> for its exceptionally friendly exposition.
