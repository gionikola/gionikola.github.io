> "If you're teaching a class, you can think about the elementary things that you know very well. These things are kind of fun and delightful. It doesn't do any harm to think them over again. Is there a better way to present them? Are there any new problems associated with them? Are there any new thoughts you can make about them? The elementary things are easy to think about; if you can't think of a new thought, no harm done; what you thought about it before is good enough for the class. If you do think of something new, you're rather pleased that you have a new way of looking at it... The questions of the students are often the source of new research. They often ask profound questions that I've thought about at times and then given up on, so to speak, for a while. It wouldn't do any harm to think about them again and see if I can go any further now. The students may not be able to see the thing I want to answer, or the subtleties I want to think about, but they remind me of a problem by asking questions in the neighborhood of that problem... I find that teaching and the students keep life going, and I would never accept any position in which somebody has invented a happy situation for me where I don't have to teach. Never."

# <b>Independent Courses</b>

The following is a list of courses that I have independently prepared and taught as the instructor of record.

### <b>Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory (EC313)</b>

Asynchronous. Spring 2023. Class size: 120.

<b>Description:</b> 
This class is designed to provide economics majors and minors, as well as interested non-majors, the theoretical foundations necessary to understand the macroeconomic problems commonly confronted in developed market economies, and to evaluate solutions to those problems. 
I teach students how to build models that help explain fluctuations in output, employment, the price level, inflation, interest rates, and other key macroeconomic variables. 
Students also learn how to use models to understand how policy changes (for example, monetary policy, tax reductions, and deficit spending) may affect macroeconomic variables, with primary applications to the U.S. and other developed economies.
I build my course content around Olivier Blanchard's 8th edition of <i>Macroeconomics</i> using recent data, and provide more detailed coverage of certain topics.

### <b>Money and Banking (EC370)</b>

Fall 2021. Winter 2023. Class size: 60.

<b>Description:</b> 
In this course I teach students how the monetary and banking systems function, interact, and ultimately cause fluctuations in the macroeconomy.
I tend to put more emphasis on an intuitive understanding of how the incentives of key players and institutions across both systems drive their decision-making, which I leverage to construct simplified yet informative models of the aggregate economy.
I then try to apply the models to as many historical episodes and realistic hypothetical scenarios as I possibly can, given the time constraint. 
The usual required textbook for this course at University of Oregon is Frederic Mishkin's <i>Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i>, but I prefer to use Laurence Ball's <i>Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i> while also drawing upon Mishkin's materials and <i>Foundations of Financial Markets and Institutions</i> (Fabozzi et al.).

### <b>Monetary Policy (EC470)</b>

Summer 2021. Class size: 30.

<b>Description:</b>
In this course I teach students how the monetary system functions, and how central banks may use monetary policy to manipulate its trajectory.
I put less emphasis on quantitative modeling skills (for which the UO Econ. Department offers other advanced macroeconomics courses), and more on economic intuition, historical awareness, and institutional knowledge.
Similar to EC370, the required textbook for this course at University of Oregon is Frederic Mishkin's <i>Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i>, but I prefer to use Laurence Ball's <i>Money, Banking and Financial Markets</i> for its exceptionally friendly exposition.
