When undergraduate students begin learning econometrics, they're required to master a few unrelated skills:

1. Probabilistic and statistical thinking
2. Calculus and (linear) algebra
3. Programming in R (at UO -- the language of choice may vary by school)

In my experience, students tend to struggle or neglect programming skills when starting out, mainly due to a complete lack of familiarity.

This page provides a list of links to carefully-selected free online resources that will hopefully ease students' transition into econometric programming using R.
